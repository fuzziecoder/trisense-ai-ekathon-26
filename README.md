# 🩺 TriSense AI — Early Clinical Deterioration & Sepsis Prediction System

TriSense AI is an **AI-powered early warning system** that detects clinical deterioration before visible collapse occurs. It analyzes time-series vital sign data to generate **explainable risk alerts**, enabling clinicians to intervene early and improve patient outcomes.

Built for real-world healthcare environments, TriSense focuses on **trend-based detection**, not static threshold monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Overview

In hospital settings, patients often show subtle physiological changes hours before critical events such as:

- Sepsis
- Cardiac arrest
- Respiratory failure
- Septic shock

Traditional monitoring systems rely on fixed thresholds and snapshot readings, which may miss gradual deterioration.

### TriSense solves this by:

- Learning patient baseline patterns
- Monitoring vital trends continuously
- Detecting abnormal deviations early
- Providing explainable risk alerts
- Supporting clinical decision-making

## 🧠 System Architecture

Patient Vitals → Feature Engineering → Time-Series Encoder → Risk Classifier → Explanation Engine → Alert System


### Pipeline Flow

1. Vital signs collected
2. Features extracted (trend, change rate, clinical scores)
3. Time-series model learns patterns
4. Risk prediction generated
5. Explanation provided
6. Alert triggered if risk high

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 1. Data Generator (`data_generator.py`)
- Generates labeled clinical data
- Simulates patient vital patterns
- Uses clinical rules (qSOFA, SIRS, Shock Index)

### 2. Feature Engineering (`feature_engineering.py`)
Creates clinical features such as:
- Rate of change
- Vital slopes
- Percentage change
- Z-score normalization
- Shock index
- Trend deviations

### 3. Time-Series Encoder (`patchtst_encoder.py`)
- Transformer-based model
- Learns temporal patterns in vital signs
- Generates time-series embeddings

### 4. Risk Classifier (`xgboost_classifier.py`)
- Predicts deterioration probability
- Optimized for high recall
- Outputs risk percentage

### 5. Training Pipeline (`train_pipeline.py`)
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Model saving

### 6. Inference Engine (`inference.py`)
Main prediction interface:

```python
{
  "risk_percentage": 78,
  "risk_category": "HIGH",
  "explanation": "Rising heart rate + falling blood pressure"
}

7. AI Agents (Decision Layer)
Alert Agent — triggers alerts

Pattern Agent — detects physiological patterns

Trend Agent — analyzes time-series changes

Reasoning Agent — explains predictions

Suggestion Agent — provides recommendations\

8. Backend API (main.py)
Serves prediction endpoints

Connects ML pipeline

9. Frontend Dashboard
Displays patient risk

Shows alerts

Visualizes trends
